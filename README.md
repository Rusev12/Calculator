# Salary Calculator

This program allows an employer or employee to keep track of hours worked, what the salary was for each time period entry (default is daily), and how much they earned for that entry. It calculates the total hours and minutes worked as well as the amount earned based on a 'Time Start' and 'Time End' for the specific entry. Users can than choose specific dates or date ranges to display.

## Features

- Create daily wage data (time period worked, total hours, wage, and amount earned) and store in an Entity database
- Search for data between specified dates using dual JS calendars
- Editing and deletion of data updates to database automatically

### Future To-Dos:

- [ ] Add various validation

### Notes

This project was needed for an en-US system but required the view to display yen with appropriate formatting (no decimals). This can easily be adjusted as needed by modifying the code in the index view.
